# Experimental-vs-Theoretical-Probability
- The program creates a graph for experimental and theoretical probability in regards to coin flipping.
- The main trend that the graph is demonstrating is the tendency for experimental probability to approach theoretical probability as the number of trials increases.
- Data is generated using simulated coin flips.
- Pyplot from Matplotlib is used to graph the data.
