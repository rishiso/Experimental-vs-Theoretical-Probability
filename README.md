# Law of Large Numbers
- The program graphs the experimental and theoretical probabiity of coin flipping to illustrate the Law of Large Numbers.
- The Law of Large Numbers is the tendency for the experimental probability to approach theoretical probability as the number of performed trials increases (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers for more information).
- Pyplot from Matplotlib is used to graph the data.
