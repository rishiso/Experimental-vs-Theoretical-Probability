# Experimental-vs-Theoretical-Probability
- The program illustrates the relationship between experimental and theoretical probability in regards to coin flipping.
- The main trend that the program is demonstrating is the tendency for experimental probability to approach theoretical probability as the number of trials increase.
- Pyplot from Matplotlib is used to graph the data.
- The max number of coin flips can be adjusted using the "max_flips" variable.
